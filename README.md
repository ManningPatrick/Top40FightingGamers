An exploration of the top 40 fighting-game players using various metrics. Who is the greatest player of all time and why?


###Motivation

Fighting-games have been a passion of mine since I was a young teenager, pumping tokens into the machines at the arcade. As the video game industry continues to grow, how are the Fighting-Game Community (FGC) and it's players keeping up? How should we define the "greatest player of all time" (GOAT)? 


###Data Questions

Who is the greatest fighting-game player? Using these metrics: total earnings, offline/online earnings, games placed, and prizes per year.
How has the pandemic affected players ability to earn a living?


###Know Issues and Challenges

Web scraping esportsearnings and cleaning and organizing the data was very challenging. I pulled 10 metrics for the years 2003-2021 and created tables and charts to visualize the data and help tell a story. 

Gather, clean, organize and analyze data from esportsearnings.com to determine who the greatest fighting-game player of all time is. Explore the data and interesting questions or insights the data may provide. 
Create visualizations for a presentaion. Technologies used: Python, Google Slides, and PowerBI
